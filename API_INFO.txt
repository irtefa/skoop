Here's what the server returns:


{'documents': [...documents...], 'classifiers': [...classifiers...]}

where documents are a list of doc objects:
  Example Doc: {rank:0, scores: [.5, .2, .1], title:"test", url:"www.test.com"}

and classifiers is a list of lists of data about each classifier
  ["Axis Label", "Low Label", "High Label"]


The classifier labels appear in the same order as the scores in each doc
