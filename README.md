Traditional search engines like Google or Bing often fail to differentiate results based on constraints other than relevance. Even with features like Googleâ€™s Advanced Search, users are not able to visually filter the results. Our search engine will allow users to search using a query as well as multiple constraints (up to 4) upon which the results will be visualized in a graphical interface rather than purely text.

Anybody looking for a more visual search experience would benefit from this tool.  It provides a deeper, more intuitive way to search for results and compare results to one another quickly based on multiple constraints.
